            <p>My name is Adeola Abdulramon. I am a Frontend Engineer who loves the Web and Emerging Technologies. </p>
            <p>
              I currently work as an intermediate Frontend Engineer where I work at the intersection of PWA and E-commerce Platforms. I have a Bachelor of Science in Education (Physics) from the Obafemi Awolowo University Affiliate Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, Nigeria.
            </p>
            <p>I have a blog on medium, where I post content on Frontend Engineering, and Frontend Development.</p>
            <p>My non-tech passion includes entrepreneurship and teaching. I believe everyone should be given a chance at basic education.</p>
            <p>In tech, I am a huge fan of the web and emerging technologies. At a tech event, you'd probably find me volunteering, networking, and meeting new people.</p>
            <p>I am also passionate about the developer community and improving Nigeriaâ€™s e-commerce ecosystem with technology.</p>
